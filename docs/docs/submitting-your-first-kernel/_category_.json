    "description": "We distinguish between Python and CUDA leaderboards. 
    The primary difference is what language/frameworks kernel 
    evaluation happens in. In Python leaderboards, data will typically be 
    stored as PyTorch tensors (e.g. the Storage abstraction), while in CUDA leaderboards, 
    data will be allocated as contiguous chunks of memory. As we will discuss, you can 
    still inline compile CUDA code for your Python submissions."
