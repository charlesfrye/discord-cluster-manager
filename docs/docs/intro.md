# Getting Started
Welcome! If you are excited about building GPU kernels, this leaderboard is the place for you! We
have designed a fully-functional competition platform on [Discord](https://discord.com/), where users can **submit their own
kernel implementations** for popular algorithms (e.g. matrix multiplication, softmax, [LLaMA 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) inference, etc.) and compete to produce the fastest kernels.

Users interface directly with a Discord bot, which runs and measures various metrics for their
kernel submissions on our own cloud compute, so **participants can compete without their own GPUs**!
We are gracious to our sponsors for providing these community resources.

## Why a GPU Kernel Competition?

## How the Competition Works

## Participating
We have tried to make the platform as intuitive as possible, but we are open to feedback. You are
now ready to submit your first leaderboard kernel -- go to the next section to begin!
